## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it responsibly:

1. **Do NOT open a public issue**
2. Email the maintainer or use GitHub's private vulnerability reporting feature
3. Include:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact
   - Suggested fix (if any)

## Security Considerations

### Cookie Handling
- The `NETEASE_COOKIE` environment variable contains session credentials
- Never commit `.env` files or expose cookies in logs
- The server does not log cookie values
- Cookies are only sent to `music.163.com` endpoints

### Network Security
- By default, the server binds to `0.0.0.0` for container deployments
- In production, use a reverse proxy with HTTPS
- Every endpoint except `GET /health` requires `Authorization: Bearer <MCP_BEARER_TOKEN>`
- The server refuses to start when `MCP_BEARER_TOKEN` is missing or shorter than 16 characters
- The token is compared in constant time and is never written to logs
- `GET /health` returns only status, tool count, and version — no account data

### Data Privacy
- This server accesses your personal NetEase Cloud Music account
- No data is stored locally (stateless design)
- No data is sent to third parties
- All API calls go directly to music.163.com

## Best Practices for Deployment

1. Use environment variables for all secrets
2. Set a long random `MCP_BEARER_TOKEN` and send it only in the `Authorization` header
3. Run behind a reverse proxy with TLS
4. Restrict network access to trusted clients only
5. Rotate your NetEase cookie and the bearer token periodically
6. Monitor logs for unauthorized requests
